InvRipper readme 
====================


=====================================
Stand Alone use with svn checkout;

start oog.exe edit character config and change scripts from YAMB or ntbot-scripts to InvRipper
save and start.  This is will automatically start DIO (Darien's Inventory OOG) 
and cycle through all of the accounts configured in settings/Darien/DIO.ini
you can config minor stuff in invripper.ini as well.

=====================================

For use with YAMB

1. change the name of your starter.dbj to starterNORM.dbj
2. edit your default.dbj to load("tools/invripper.dbj"); OR rename it to defaultNORM.dbj and use the default.dbj included
3. dump the rest of these files in your D2BS/YAMB install folder. (take special note to dump all the pics into the output/invripper/jpg folder)
4. edit the list of accounts to log with DIO.ini and you can config minor stuff in invripper.ini as well.
5. Use OGG to load, doesn't matter which character as DIO's stater.dbj will take over and start logging all of your characters



===============================================
viewing inventorys after characters are logged

1. after you characters are logged go to output/invripper/USWest (or other Realm Folder) and open index.html with IE 6 or above.
2.You will get a pop up asking to "allow blocked content", allow content to run, invripper needs the active x controls.
3. You will have to configure IE to allow Active X content. 
4.In IE 8 you click Tools drop down menu, click Internet Options.
5.select Advanced Tab, Scroll down to Security and check box for "Allow active content to run in files on My Computer."




Any time you're ready to use invripper, just use IE to open index.html for whatever realm you're using.

you can click on the list of characters in the side bar to see their inventory, 
click the mode: in the upper right corner to switch between inventory view (my favorite) and list view. 
list view has both high and low detail subviews.

You can also use the search function to search your database of mules for a particular item based on name or attributes.
search for "stone of jordan" or +30 to strength or whatever you want.
after searching for an item you'll see a list of what it found on which character. 
Click the characters name and it will show you a list view of that characters inventory, 
click mode and you'll be viewing the inventory view for that character.


enjoy,
